## Overview

This project examines how **galvanic interactions between dissimilar metals** influence corrosion and material removal during **Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP)**.  
Since modern devices often integrate multiple metallic layers, galvanic coupling can significantly affect **surface stability**, **defect formation**, and overall **CMP performance**.

---

## Objectives

- Explore tribo-electrochemical methods for evaluating galvanic corrosion under polishing conditions.  
- Identify how galvanic effects modify passivation, dissolution, and removal mechanisms in CMP.  
- Provide experimental strategies to better assess galvanic interactions in multi-metal CMP environments.

---

## Methods

- Coupling polishing experiments with electrochemical measurements (OCP, polarization, impedance).  
- Modeling galvanic corrosion scenarios where active and passive metals contact under slurry exposure.  
- Assessing the role of slurry composition, pressure, and abrasion in amplifying or mitigating galvanic effects.

---

## Key Findings

- **Galvanic coupling** can accelerate corrosion of the less noble metal, especially when mechanical abrasion disrupts passive films.  
- **Electrochemical signals under load** reveal synergistic effects of friction, slurry chemistry, and galvanic driving forces.  
- Correct interpretation requires careful consideration of **contact area differences** and **dynamic film breakdown** during CMP.

## Relevance

Understanding galvanic effects is vital for:

- **Multi-metal CMP integration** (e.g., Cu, Co, Mo, Ru stacks)  
- Designing **slurries and inhibitors** that minimize cross-metal corrosion  
- Improving **reliability in advanced interconnect and barrier layer processing**
