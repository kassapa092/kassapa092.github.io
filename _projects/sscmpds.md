## Overview

This project investigates how **citrate-based slurries** influence the chemical and mechanical removal of **stainless steel (SS304/SS316)** during **Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP)**.  
Stainless steel, though widely used in flexible devices and sensor substrates, is challenging to polish due to its strong passive oxide layers.

---

## Objectives

- Clarify how citrate ligands interact with **Fe, Cr, and Ni** at the SS surface during polishing.  
- Examine the role of **oxidizers**, **complexing agents**, and **slurry chemistry** in modifying removal rates.  
- Link **tribological abrasion** with **electrochemical film breakdown** to define the removal mechanism.

---

## Methods

- **Electrochemical analysis** (OCP, polarization, impedance) under slurry conditions  
- **Polishing tests** with controlled load and slurry composition  
- **Surface analysis** to track oxide/complex layer formation and removal

---

## Key Findings

- **Citrate buffers** promote surface complexation, weakening the passive oxide and making it more susceptible to abrasion.  
- Removal is governed by a **cyclic mechanism**:  
  1. Surface passivation  
  2. Citrate-assisted destabilization  
  3. Mechanical polishing  
- The synergy between **electrochemical activity** and **padâ€“abrasive contact** drives steady-state material removal.

## Relevance

- Provides new mechanistic insights into **non-traditional CMP materials** like stainless steel  
- Supports the design of **environmentally friendly, pH-controlled slurries** for emerging applications  
- Advances CMP for **flexible electronics**, **displays**, and **biomedical devices** where stainless steel foils are used as substrates
