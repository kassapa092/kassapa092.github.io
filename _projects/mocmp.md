### Overview

This project investigates how **molybdenum (Mo)** and **copper (Cu)** surfaces interact with weakly alkaline **citrate-based CMP slurries**, aiming to clarify the chemical and electrochemical mechanisms that drive material removal.  
Mo and Cu are both relevant to **semiconductor interconnects** and **barrier layers**, but they exhibit different behaviors during polishing.

---

### Objectives

- Identify how citrate ligands and oxidizers promote surface film formation and dissolution.  
- Compare removal rates, corrosion responses, and passivation behaviors of Mo vs. Cu.  
- Link electrochemical measurements with tribological removal data to establish a unified mechanistic picture.

---

### Methods

- **Electrochemical analysis**: OCP, polarization, and impedance spectroscopy under slurry conditions.  
- **CMP experiments** with varying slurry chemistries (citrate concentration, oxidizer presence, pH).  
- **Surface characterization** before and after polishing to detect oxide/complex formation.

---

### Key Findings

- **Cu removal** is dominated by citrate-assisted dissolution, forming stable Cuâ€“citrate complexes that allow continuous polishing.  
- **Mo shows more complex behavior**: citrate promotes oxide film porosity and partial dissolution, which makes the surface vulnerable to abrasion, enhancing removal rates.  
- The study highlights that **synergy between chemical complexation and mechanical abrasion** is essential for effective CMP of both metals.

### Relevance

By clarifying how weakly alkaline citrate systems act on Mo and Cu, this work provides valuable guidance for:

- Designing **environmentally friendlier CMP slurries** (milder pH, biodegradable ligands).  
- Tailoring processes for **next-generation interconnect/barrier CMP**.  
- Expanding CMP technology to **new materials beyond traditional Cu/Co systems**.
