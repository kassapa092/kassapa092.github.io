## Overview

**Chemical–Mechanical Planarization (CMP)** is a critical process in semiconductor manufacturing that combines mechanical abrasion and electrochemical surface modification to achieve ultra-flat surfaces. However, when CMP involves metals (e.g., Cu, Co, Ru, SS), the interplay between **tribology** (friction, abrasion) and **electrochemical reactions** becomes highly complex.  
In this project, I review and develop experimental strategies to probe, quantify, and understand these **tribo-electrochemical** processes in model metal CMP systems.

## Objectives

- Critically assess available laboratory techniques for coupling electrochemistry with tribology under CMP-like conditions.  
- Identify the strengths, limitations, and sources of artifacts in each method when applied to metal CMP interfaces.  
- Provide guidance on how to design experiments that can tease apart mechanistic contributions (e.g. passivation, wear, tribo-corrosion) to material removal rates (MRRs).  
- Chart future directions in measurement strategies that can bridge the gap between idealized experiments and real-world CMP tools.

## Methods & Approaches

To realize these objectives, the project explores (and sometimes implements) the following:

### Three-Electrode Model CMP Cells

- Integrating a polishing tool with a three-electrode electrochemical cell: the metal sample acts as the **working electrode (WE)**, supported by a **reference electrode (RE)** and **counter electrode (CE)**.  
- Using a **Teflon slurry chamber** to maintain an electrolyte environment closing around the pad-sample interface.

### Electrochemical Techniques under Mechanical Load

- Open-circuit potential (OCP) transients  
- Potentiodynamic polarization / Tafel analysis  
- Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)  
- Chronoamperometry / chronopotentiometry  

These are applied during sliding contact to observe how mechanical abrasion perturbs or modulates electrochemical responses.

### Control of Mechanical / Polishing Variables

- Varying downforce (pressure) and relative sliding velocity, linked to classic CMP models (e.g. **Preston’s law**)  
- Analysis of regimes (hydrodynamic, mixed lubrication, boundary) where solid contact vs. fluid film dominates  
- Considering pad–wafer contact area, active abrasives, and slurry transport effects

### Normalization & Area Considerations

- Distinguishing mechanical contact area and electrochemical effective area, especially in CMP where only portions of the surface undergo abrasion  
- Strategies to minimize artifacts such as **ohmic drop fluctuations (iRₛ)** or potential noise from moving electrodes

### Case Studies & Illustrative Data

The review also presents selected measurement examples (some new or previously unpublished) to demonstrate how the proposed methods provide insight into metal CMP behavior.

## Key Insights & Implications

- The cyclic formation and removal of a chemically modified surface film (oxide, hydroxide, or metal complexes) underlies the CMP of metals: the film is weakened chemically and then abraded mechanically.  
- Tribological variables—pressure, velocity, pad properties—can alter electrochemical kinetics and therefore change the material removal path.  
- Careful experimental design is vital: electrode placement, slurry conductivity, mechanical stability, and electrode motion can all introduce measurement artifacts if not managed.  
- Bridging ideal lab studies with industrial CMP systems remains a major challenge, particularly because real tools have nonuniform pressures, slurry flows, and scale effects.

## Relevance to My Work

This project underpins my ongoing research in CMP of metals and alloys.  
By systematizing how to measure tribo-electrochemical behavior, this work provides a robust foundation for my laboratory’s later studies on **Co/SS CMP**, **barrier metal CMP** (e.g. Ru, Ti), and **slurry design optimization**.  
It also positions me to translate mechanistic insight into actionable process improvements in semiconductor manufacturing.
