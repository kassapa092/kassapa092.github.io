I am a Ph.D. researcher in Physics specializing in Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP) and tribo-electrochemistry.
My work focuses on developing eco-friendly slurries, post-CMP cleaning strategies, and multi-metal polishing solutions that improve surface quality, reliability, and yield in semiconductor manufacturing and flexible electronics. 
I bridge fundamental research with industry-driven process development, aiming to deliver progressive solutions for IC fabrication and advanced materials processing.
