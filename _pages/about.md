## Ph.D. Research and Academic Journey

I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Physics at **Clarkson University** (Potsdam, NY), where my research is dedicated to advancing the understanding of **Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP)** and **tribo-electrochemistry** of metals and alloys. 
My academic and professional journey has been shaped by a deep interest in how **surface science**, **electrochemistry**, and **tribology** converge to enable next-generation semiconductor and flexible device technologies.

### Educational Background

My educational path began with a strong foundation in Physics at the undergraduate level, where I gained broad training in classical and modern physics. I continued into graduate studies with a **Masterâ€™s degree**, focusing on **materials science applications**, before advancing into my current doctoral program.

Along the way, I built expertise in theoretical frameworks through advanced coursework, including:Statistical Mechanics, Quantum Mechanics, Electromagnetic Theory, Solid State Physics, Electroanalytical Methods, Nuclear Physics, Chemistry at Surfaces, Colloids & Interfaces  

This academic training provided me with the tools to analyze complex material behaviors both from a fundamental perspective and in applied contexts.

### CMP Research Focus at Clarkson

My doctoral research has concentrated on several interrelated CMP projects:

- **Developing experimental strategies** for tribo-electrochemical studies, coupling polishing setups with electrochemical instrumentation to probe surface reactions in real time.  
- **Investigating molybdenum and copper CMP** in citrate-based slurries, clarifying how ligand-assisted dissolution and oxide destabilization enable removal.  
- **Exploring galvanic corrosion mechanisms** in multi-metal CMP environments, relevant for barrier and interconnect integration in advanced ICs.  
- **Studying stainless-steel CMP** with citrate buffers, opening pathways for using SS foils as substrates in flexible electronics, solar cells, and biomedical devices.  
- **Designing tartrate-based post-CMP cleaning chemistries** for copper films, demonstrating selective oxide removal and defect reduction with brush scrubbing.  

### Leadership and Teaching Experience

Beyond research, I have served as the **lead of my graduate laboratory**, managing equipment maintenance, budgeting, lab safety, and mentoring of graduate and undergraduate researchers.

Since **2019**, I have also worked as a **teaching assistant in Physics**, guiding students in experimental labs, problem-solving, and scientific communication.

### Vision and Long-Term Goals

Taken together, my path reflects a consistent progression: from mastering the fundamentals of physics, to applying electrochemical and tribological principles in CMP research, to shaping solutions for semiconductor manufacturing and emerging flexible device technologies.

My long-term goal is to **translate this academic expertise into industry-focused process development**, helping to deliver more reliable, sustainable, and innovative CMP solutions for future technology nodes.
