My research focuses on electrochemistry, specifically chemical-mechanical planarization (CMP) and related tribo-electrochemical processes. 

I investigate the tribo-electrochemical aspects of CMP, explore the mechanisms of material removal for metals and alloys such as molybdenum, copper, cobalt and stainless steel, and develop experimental strategies to analyze both electrochemical and mechanical characteristics. 
 
Additionally, I study corrosion, wear, and evaluate CMP slurries using tribo-electroanalytical methods. 
My work contributes to advancing semiconductor manufacturing and surface finishing technologies.
